# RK8D - A retro, containerized gaming experience

This is going to be a small project where I will recreate a few arcade games using Python. I'll then bundl the games and containerize them as a single image so people. This will ensure that anyone who can run Docker will be able to play my arcade games. I'll add more games in the future.


## What This Includes
`pong.py`: This is a python version of the game pong. It's a very bare-bones version of the game. I'll be adding new features to the game first and then containerizing it.


# Getting Started

## Requirements
You'll need one of the following
* Python 
* Docker


## Quick Start
You can go to [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/crc8109/RK8D) to see where I'm hosting the image for RK8D as it is now. It only includes the game pong for now.

## Starting from Scratch
Clone the repo. Then run `python3 pong.py`. That will start the only game made so far.
